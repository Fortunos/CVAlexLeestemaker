Bonus assignments implemented:
Triangle support
Spotlights
Anti-Aliasing


List of materials used to implement the ray tracer:
Code for triangle intersection was inspired by the C code given on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm
Anti-aliasing is done by using a uniformly distributed grid algorithm as described on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersampling
Anti-aliasing can be activated in the code by setting the boolean variable in raytracer.cs to true
